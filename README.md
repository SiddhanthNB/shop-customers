#  Customer segmentation and Clustering analysis 

We have given with a dataset consisting of customers visiting to the shop. With customers as observations having Satisfaction and Loyalty scores. Where Satisfaction is the review given by the customer on the scale of 10. And Loyalty is the metric caluclated using several factors like frequency of purchases from the mall, no. of visits to the mall, no. of feedbacks given etc.

We need to group the customers into different clusters, so that the shop can shape business decisions and have targets for better profit margins.

We will be using two different clustering methods to find an optimum result on our clustering analysis.
